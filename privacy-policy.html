      <h1>Privacy Policy - ProAi</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 27, 2025</p>

      <p>
        Netro Systems ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your
        privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and manage
        your information while you use the Pro AI app ("the App"). By using the
        App, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The Pro AI app does not require or use any authentication system. As
        such, we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information
        ("PII") such as your name, email address, or phone number.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">In-App Purchases</h2>
      <p>
        Subscriptions for Pro AI are handled through Google Play Console’s
        In-App Purchase system. We do not process or store any payment or
        billing information. Please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy for details
        on how your payment information is handled:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"
          >Google Privacy Policy</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Usage Data</h2>
      <p>
        To improve the performance and functionality of the App, we may collect
        anonymized usage data, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Device information (e.g., device model and operating system version).
        </li>
        <li>
          Interaction metrics (e.g., how often specific features are used).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is collected solely to enhance the App's functionality and
        user experience. It cannot be used to identify individual users.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">How You Use Pro AI</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The App offers free trials for image generation and chat features.
          After the free trial period, you will need an active subscription to
          continue using these features.
        </li>
        <li>
          As long as you have an active subscription, you can use the App to
          chat and generate images without restrictions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title">Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Pro AI app may interact with third-party services (e.g., AI models
        or APIs) to provide its core functionalities. These services may collect
        and process data related to your interactions within the App. All such
        data is anonymized and cannot identify you personally.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect any data collected through the
        App. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission over the
        internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Pro AI is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do
        not knowingly collect any data from children. If you believe a child has
        used the App and provided data, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@netrosystems.com">support@netrosystems.com</a>
        so we can take appropriate action.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Since the App does not collect personal information, there is no data to
        access, correct, or delete. However, if you have any concerns or
        questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at
        <a href="mailto:support@netrosystems.com">support@netrosystems.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Policy Updates</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make
        significant changes, we will notify users by updating the "Effective
        Date" at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy
        periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your privacy.
